# Scientific MicroPython on Microcontrollers - SciPy 2018 Tutorial
Austin-TX, July 10th 2018

MicroPython (http://micropython.org/) is a free and open source implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on a microcontroller with MHz and tens of Kbytes of RAM, giving a low-level Python operating system running interactive prompt or scripts.

MicroPython microcontroller boards have many electronic interfaces : digital input/output (GPIO) ports, analog inputs (via Analog Digital Converter - ADC), analog outputs (via Digital to Analog Converter - ADC), wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, SigFox, etc), etc. So MicroPython on microcontroller boards can be used to control all kinds of electronic and IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

The presenter will bring with him 30 kits (for 30 attendees), each one composed of 1 microcontroller board with WiFi, MicroPython installed, 1 pressure/temperature sensor, 1 accelerometer sensor, jumper cables. The attendee should bring a microUSB cable to connect his/her notebook to the microcontroller board.

Learning goals from attendees point of view :
- know the features of MicroPython;
- have the oportunity to taste MicroPython on a real microcontroller board;
- practice MicroPython in interactive mode and using script files;
- connect and read sensors using MicroPython;
- practice with some MicroPython scientific modules to process sensor data;
- publish sensor data on local web server or IoT Cloud.
